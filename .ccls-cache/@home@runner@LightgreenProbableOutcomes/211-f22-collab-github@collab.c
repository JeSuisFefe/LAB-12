// One person in your partner group should clone this repository.
// Create a function that outputs your name, along with either one thing 
//    that you learned about git or GitHub or something that gave you trouble
//    that you would like others to learn from. The function name should be
//    your NetID combined with your partner's NetID.
// Feel free to add other things to your function as well, though be mindful
// of the length of it, given how many students will be collaborating on this code!
// 
// Read through the code that is already here before adding your own.
// Add this code to the repository using git commands.
// 
// An example is shown below.
